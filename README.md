# ABOUT ME
My name is Aaron Dominic. I am a first-year student at Raritan Valley Community College and I am currently taking my major in Information Technology. I am currently 23 years old and I have only recently gained my passion into building computers and anything tech-related.

# PROJECT INFORMATION
 This project contains a sneak peek of my life; my hobbies, my passion, my dreams, or simply any interests along the way. This project is developed through the help of Professor Steven Caruso; his lectures have helped pave the way how my website looks and have assisted into resolving issues with my project.

# COLOR SCHEME
I chose the color scheme that appears warm and inviting. A color palette that reflects a little bit of my personality.
