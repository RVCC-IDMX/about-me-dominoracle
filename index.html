                <p>I am currently a part time employee at a cafeteria and a full time student. <br>
                    I like to collect figurines, books, shoes, and clothes. <br>
                    I play a lot of video games during my free time and watch video essays about said video games.</p>

            <h2> Stuff I like doing</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>PLaying video games</li>
                <li>Watching sports</li>

                <li>PC parts shopping</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>More about my hobbies!</h2>
            <p>As you might tell, I have a fond passion for technology and gaming. Right now, I like building computers as well as configuring them to have the best gaming experience for a gamer like me. I like watching sports like the NBA (National Basketball Association), the NFL (National Football League), and FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association). I used to play a lot of sports at school and for recreation before I began wearing glasses for my near-sightedness. I used to be competitive in sports and I would join many intramural events when I was younger. <br>
            I also like watching esports for games like League of Legends, Counter Strike, Valorant, and many more. My passion for gaming has begun since my father bought us a Playstation 3. I used to play games like NBA 2K, Call of Duty, and many single-player games like the Assassin's Creed series, Hitman, and Tomb Raider. I consider myself competitive in gaming as I like to acquire the in-game achievements and I like to perform well in Player versus Player games.<br>
            I have also recently gotten interested in reading books, more so leaning towards self-help books and books to boost my knowledge about social and emotional intelligence. <br>
            I also like to shop for sneakers and talk about what kind of brands are trending with my friends. I also like to shop for computer parts when it is necessary for me to upgrade my personal computer. I like keeping up with the tech and almost a lot of recent trends online. </p>

                <p>"It is our French gold," whispered the director. "We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it."</p>

                <p>"Your French gold?"</p>

                <p>"Yes. We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose 30,000 napoleons from the Bank of France. It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money, and that it is still lying in our cellar. The crate upon which I sit contains 2,000 napoleons packed between layers of lead foil. Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office, and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject."</p>

                <p>"Which were very well justified," observed Holmes. "And now it is time that we arranged our little plans. I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head. In the meantime Mr. Merryweather, we must put the screen over that dark lantern."</p>

                <p>"And sit in the dark?"</p>

                <p>"I am afraid so. I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket, and I thought that, as we were a partie carrée, you might have your rubber after all. But I see that the enemy's preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk the presence of a light. And, first of all, we must choose our positions. These are daring men, and though we shall take them at a disadvantage, they may do us some harm unless we are careful. I shall stand behind this crate, and do you conceal yourselves behind those. Then, when I flash a light upon them, close in swiftly. If they fire, Watson, have no compunction about shooting them down."</p>
